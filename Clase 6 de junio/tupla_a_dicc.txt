Python – Convert Nested Tuple to Custom Key Dictionary

Sometimes, while working with Python records, we can have data that come 
without proper column names/identifiers, which can just be identified by their index,
but we intend to assign them keys and render in form of dictionaries. 
This kind of problem can have applications in domains such as web development. 
Let’s discuss certain ways in which this task can be performed.

Input : test_tuple = ((1, ‘Gfg’, 2), (3, ‘best’, 4)), keys = [‘key’, ‘value’, ‘id’] 
Output : [{‘key’: 1, ‘value’: ‘Gfg’, ‘id’: 2}, {‘key’: 3, ‘value’: ‘best’, ‘id’: 4}] 

Input : test_tuple = test_tuple = ((1, ‘Gfg’), (2, 3)), keys = [‘key’, ‘value’] 
Output : [{‘key’: 1, ‘value’: ‘Gfg’}, {‘key’: 2, ‘value’: 3}]
